- **Performance Optimized**: Indexed for fast queries
- **Admin Interface**: Web-based dashboard for monitoring
 
### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
Comprehensive email tracking interface with:
 
**Real-time Statistics:**
- Total emails sent
- Open rates and click rates
- Recent activity (last 24 hours)
- Performance analytics
 
**Email Management:**
- Search and filter email history
- View detailed email information
- Track delivery status and events
- Monitor engagement metrics
 
**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /admin/api/emails` - Get filtered email list
- `GET /admin/api/email/{tracking_id}` - Get detailed email info
- `DELETE /admin/api/cleanup/{days}` - Clean up old emails
 
### Tracking by ID System
Each email gets a unique tracking ID that enables:
 
**Status Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check specific email status
curl http://localhost:8002/email_status/{tracking_id}
```
 
**Event Recording:**
- Email opens (with IP address and timestamp)
- Click tracking (coming soon)
- Delivery confirmation from SendGrid
- User agent information for analytics
