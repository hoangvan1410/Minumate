00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.140
Kiet Nguyen: Hello, guys.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.809
Kiet Nguyen: Today, we are going to talk about a lot of things.

3
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.079
Kiet Nguyen: That is… Okay, so let me turn on the script.

4
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.540
Kiet Nguyen: Mmm, traps. Deep. Heavy.

5
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.749
Kiet Nguyen: Not the wolf.

6
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.989
Kiet Nguyen: Too big for that. Whatever it is, it's been here recently.

7
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.990
Kiet Nguyen: Geralds pauses, crouching by broken branches. Glow marks on the bark.

8
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.080
Kiet Nguyen: Widespread leashing, maybe, or something that wants me to think it's a legend.

9
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.900
Kiet Nguyen: He rises, hand on his sewer sword.

10
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.429
Kiet Nguyen: Winds changing, smell of throat and blood.

11
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.100
Kiet Nguyen: Fresh. Damn, whatever, I'm hunting, it's close.

12
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:46.969
Kiet Nguyen: He glances at the dark tree line. Could wait until morning. Less risk. But villagers don't have until morning. Guess I don't either.

13
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.340
Kiet Nguyen: Garrett.

14
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.810
Kiet Nguyen: Smirks faintly, shaking his head. Another night, another master, and they wonder why I'm so foreign to Abrams.

15
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.490
Kiet Nguyen: Okay, so it is the end of… the dialogue.
