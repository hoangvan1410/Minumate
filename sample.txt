Meeting Transcript:
 
Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our weekly project status review. Mike, can you update us on the backend development progress?
 
Mike: Sure, Sarah. We've completed the user authentication system and the core API endpoints. The database integration is about 80% done. However, we've encountered some performance issues with the search functionality that might delay us by 2-3 days.
 
Sarah: What kind of performance issues are we talking about?
 
Mike: The search queries are taking longer than expected, especially when filtering large datasets. I think we need to implement proper indexing and maybe consider caching for frequently accessed data.
 
Emma: From the design side, I've finished the wireframes for the mobile responsive version. User testing feedback was mostly positive, but we need to adjust the navigation menu - users found it confusing on smaller screens.
 
David: I've been running tests on the current build. Found 8 bugs so far - 3 are critical and need immediate attention. The login flow has some edge cases that aren't handled properly.
 
Sarah: Okay, let's prioritize. Mike, focus on the critical bugs first, then work on the search performance. Emma, can you revise the mobile navigation by end of week?
 
Emma: Absolutely. I'll have the updated designs ready by Thursday for review.
 
Mike: I'll need to coordinate with David on the critical bugs. Can we schedule a quick sync meeting tomorrow?
 
David: Yes, let's do 2 PM tomorrow. I'll have detailed bug reports ready by then.
 
Sarah: Great. One more thing - the client wants to move the demo date up by one week. That means we need to deliver a stable version by August 15th instead of August 22nd.
 
Mike: That's going to be tight, but doable if we focus on the core features first. We might need to push some nice-to-have features to the next sprint.
 
Emma: I can fast-track the essential screens and defer the advanced customization options.
 
David: I'll extend my testing hours and focus on the critical path scenarios first.
 
Sarah: Excellent teamwork. Let's reconvene on Friday to assess our progress. Mike, please send the updated timeline by Wednesday. Meeting adjourned.
